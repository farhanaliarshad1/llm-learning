Does it reference a specific line of your code?\\nRestart app or server/pc.\\nGoogle it, use ChatGPT, Bing AI etc.\\nIt is going to be rare that you are the first to have the problem, someone out there has posted the fly issue and likely the solution.\\nSearch using: <technology> <problem statement>. Example: pgcli error column c.relhasoids does not exist.\\nThere are often different solutions for the same problem due to variation in environments.\\nCheck the tech’s documentation. Use its search if available or use the browsers search function.\\nTry uninstall (this may remove the bad actor) and reinstall of application or reimplementation of action.

Describe what has changed in the environment.\\nProvide additional information in the same thread of the steps you have taken for resolution.\\nTake a break and come back later. You will be amazed at how often you figure out the solution after letting your brain rest. Get some fresh air, workout, play a video game, watch a tv show, whatever allows your brain to not think about it for a little while or even until the next day.\\nRemember technology issues in real life sometimes take days or even weeks to resolve.\\nIf somebody helped you with your problem and it's not in the FAQ, please add it there.

IMPORTANT: Download the Cloud Storage connector for Hadoop here: https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/connectors/cloud-storage#clusters\\nAs the name implies, this .jar file is what essentially connects PySpark with your GCS\\n2.) Move the .jar file to your Spark file directory. I installed Spark using homebrew on my MacOS machine and I had to create a /jars directory under \"/opt/homebrew/Cellar/apache-spark/3.2.1/ (where my spark dir is located)\\n3.) In your Python script, there are a few extra classes you’ll have to import:\\nimport pyspark\\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\\nfrom pyspark.conf import SparkConf\\nfrom pyspark.context import SparkContext\\n4.) You must set up your configurations before building your SparkSession. Here’s my code snippet:\\nconf = SparkConf() \\\\\\n.setMaster(\\'local[*]\\') \\\\\\n.setAppName(\\'test\\') \\\\\\n.set(\"spark.jars\", \"/opt/homebrew/Cellar/apache-spark/3.2.1/jars/gcs-connector-hadoop3-latest.jar\") \\\\\\n.set(\"spark.hadoop.google.cloud.auth.service.account.enable\", \"true\") \\\\\\n.set(\"spark.hadoop.google.cloud.auth.service.account.json.keyfile\", \"path/to/google_credentials.json\")\\nsc = SparkContext(conf=conf)\\nsc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(\"fs.AbstractFileSystem.gs.impl\",  \"com.google.cloud.hadoop.fs.gcs.GoogleHadoopFS\")\\nsc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(\"fs.gs.impl\", \"com.google.cloud.hadoop.fs.gcs.GoogleHadoopFileSystem\")\\nsc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(\"fs.gs.auth.service.account.json.keyfile\", \"path/to/google_credentials.json\")\\nsc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(\"fs.gs.auth.service.account.enable\", \"true\")\\n5.) Once you run that, build your SparkSession with the new parameters we’d just instantiated in the previous step:\\nspark = SparkSession.builder \\\\\\n.config(conf=sc.getConf()) \\\\\\n.getOrCreate()\\n6.)

Metrics such as accuracy, precision, lift and F scores use values from both columns of the confusion matrix. As a class distribution changes these measures will change as well, even if the fundamental classifier performance does not. ROC graphs are based upon TP rate and FP rate, in which each dimension is a strict columnar ratio, so cannot give an accurate picture of performance when there is class imbalance.\\n(Anudeep Vanjavakam)',\n",

You just update it in your folder and trigger the build one more time.\\nThey consume extra space on your disk. Unless you don’t want to re-run the previously existing containers, it is better to use the `--rm` option.\\nThe right way to say: “Why do we remove the docker container in our system?”. Well the docker image is still kept; it is the container that is not kept. Upon execution, images are not modified; only containers are.\\nThe option `--rm` is for removing containers. The images remain until you remove them manually. If you don’t specify a version when building an image, it will always rebuild and replace the latest tag. `docker images` shows you all the image you have pulled or build so far.\\nDuring development and testing you usually specify `--rm` to get the containers auto removed upon exit. Otherwise they get accumulated in a stopped state, taking up space. `docker ps -a` shows you all the containers you have in your host. Each time you change Pipfile (or any file you baked into the container), you rebuild the image under the same tag or a new tag. It’s important to understand the difference between the term “docker image” and “docker container”. Image is what we build with all the resources baked in. You can move it around, maintain it in a repository, share it. Then we use the image to spin up instances of it and they are called containers.\\nAdded by Muhammad Awon',\n",

This is called bagging.\\nXGBoost trains several models sequentially: the previous model error is used to train the following model. Weights are used to ponderate the models such as the best models have higher weights and are therefore favored for the final output. This method is called boosting.\\nNote that boosting is not necessarily better than bagging.\\nMélanie Fouesnard\\nBagging stands for “Bootstrap Aggregation” - it involves taking multiple samples with replacement to derive multiple training datasets from the original training dataset (bootstrapping), training a classifier (e.g. decision trees or stumps for Random Forests) on each such training dataset, and then combining the the predictions (aggregation) to obtain the final prediction. For classification, predictions are combined via voting; for regression, via averaging. Bagging can be done in parallel, since the various classifiers are independent. Bagging decreases variance (but not bias) and is robust against overfitting.\\nBoosting, on the other hand, is sequential - each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights - observations/samples misclassified by the previous classifier are given a higher weight, and this process is continued until a stopping condition is reached (e.g. max. No. of models is reached, or error is acceptably small, etc.). Boosting reduces bias & is generally more accurate than bagging, but can be prone to overfitting.\\nRileen',\n",

Pickle will reference the class in the global namespace (top-level code): __main__.<custom_class>.\\nWhen using waitress, waitress will load the predict_app module and this will call pickle.load, that will try to find __main__.<custom_class> that does not exist.\\nSolution:\\nPut the class into a separate module and import it in both the script that saves the model (e.g. train.py) and the script that loads the model (e.g. predict.py)\\nNote: If Flask is used (no waitress) in predict.py, and predict.py has the definition of the class, When  it is run: python predict.py, it will work because the class is in the same namespace as the one used when the model was saved (__main__).\\nDetailed info: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27732354/unable-to-load-files-using-pickle-and-multiple-modules\\nMarcos MJD\",\n",

A few individually important features might in fact be highly correlated with others, & dropping some might be fine.

       " {'text': 'Problem: I’m facing an extremely low RMSE score (eg: 4.3451e-6) - what shall I do?\\nAnswer: Recheck your code to see if your model is learning the target prior to making the prediction. If the target variable is passed in as a parameter while fitting the model, chances are the model would score extremely low. However, that’s not what you would want and would much like to have your model predict that. A good way to check that is to make sure your X_train doesn’t contain any part of your y_train. The same stands for validation too.\\nSnehangsu De (desnehangsu@gmail.com)',\n",

The access keys are what will be used by boto3 (AWS' Python API tool) to connect with the AWS servers. If there are no Access Keys how can they make sure that they have the right to access this Bucket? Maybe you're a malicious actor (Hacker for ex). The keys must be present for boto3 to talk to the AWS servers and they will provide access to the Bucket if you possess the right permissions. You can always set the Bucket as public so anyone can access it, now you don't need access keys because AWS won't care.\\nRead more here: https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html\\nAdded by Akshit Miglani\",\n",
